        The rexburg skatepark is a great place to learn and practice the basics of skating. There are several small ledges and a few rails as well as a bowl for transitions skaters. The downside of this park is that it is pretty old. There are a few really big cracks and some of the design of the park is strange and not the most skatable.
        <img src="images/sugatcity.jpg" alt="sugar city skatepark">
        Sugar city skatepark is a small park that has grown in the past years. There is not a lot there but its a great place if you love flatrails and flatground skating.
