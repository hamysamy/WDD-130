        <h2>Rexburg skatepark</h2>
        <img src="images/rexburgpark.jpg" alt="rexburg picture">
        <p>The rexburg skatepark is a great place to learn and practice the basics of skating. There are several small ledges and a few rails as well as a bowl for transitions skaters. The downside of this park is that it is pretty old. There are a few really big cracks and some of the design of the park is strange and not the most skatable. The people there are ussualy very respectful and kind. It brings people of all ages together to practice and improve their skating. Unfortanatly there is a lot of rfafiiti of some crude things, doesnt affect the skating though. One of the best parts of this park is the legde on the bottom of the park. It is one of the most butterly ledges you will ever skate. The perfect ledge for learning new tricks and practicing old ones.</p>

        <h2>Sugar City Skatepark</h2>
        <img src="images/sugatcity.jpg" alt="sugar picture">
        <p>Sugar city skatepark is a small park that has grown a little in the past years. There is not a lot there but its a great place if you love flatrails and flatground skating. There are also a few quarter pipes and many pads. Over all it is a really fun place but definetly older and not the smoothest park. its less than a 10 minute drive from BYU-idahos campus making it very close if you are wanting to skate. Since the park is'nt the biggest is is almost always not busy, leaving you plenty of room for yourself. One other downside is that is is really close to a bigger road. THis causes some debree such as dirt and sand to get on the concrete making it not the smoothest surface to ride.</p>
