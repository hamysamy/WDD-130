        <h2>KIWI LEDGE</h2>
        <img src="images/kiwiledge.jpg" alt="KIWI picture">
        <p> If you are looking for a perfect ledge this is the place for you! The KIWI ledge is a perfecets height and very smooth for grinds. The only problem is some of the cracks that make the run up a little technical. One other thing to worry about is the traffic. There are ussualy a lot fo people walking on the sidewalk so remeber to be respectful to everyone! It gets rough some of the time so you will definitly want to bring wax for an ideal experience.</p>

        <h2>5-6-7</h2>
        <img src="images/5-6-7.jpg" alt="567 picture">
        <p>5-6-7 stc are three stair sets right next to eachother which are perfect for practice. If you want to raise your confedence ins starit skating you can slowly leel up here. One thing to worry ab out is the people. If you go during the day there can be many students walking. This spot might be better for intermedete to advanced skaters but still a great spot to learn. It would be best just to go when there are not student so at night or later in the day. The run us is not the longest but it gives you enough room to hit it without strugle.</p>
